    <!-- INTRO / POSITIONING -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-48 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">What I do</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I design and build backend systems that are meant to last.
            Systems that are understandable, maintainable and resilient
            even years after the initial implementation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            My primary focus is backend development, but my full-stack
            background allows me to understand products as a whole —
            from database design and APIs to frontend needs and user experience.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Over the years, I’ve learned that technical excellence alone
            is not enough. The best systems are those that balance
            technical soundness with real-world constraints.
        </p>

    <!-- CORE AREAS -->
    <section class="mb-48">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-16">Core areas</h2>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-12">
            <div class="bg-slate-900 rounded-2xl p-10 space-y-6">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Backend & architecture</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    I focus on clean backend architecture, clear responsibilities
                    and data models that reflect the domain.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    I prefer boring, proven technologies used in a thoughtful way.
                    Stability and clarity usually beat novelty.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Pragmatic engineering</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    I strongly believe in pragmatic decision-making.
                    Not every problem needs a complex solution.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    Choosing the right level of abstraction is often
                    more important than choosing the newest framework.
                </p>

                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    I actively work on my own micro-SaaS ideas.
                    Small, focused tools solving concrete problems.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    Owning the entire lifecycle brings valuable insights
                    into product thinking, maintenance and real users.

    <!-- HOW I THINK -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-48 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">How I think about software</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Software is a long-term investment. Decisions made today
            will affect the team and the product years later.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I aim to reduce cognitive load for future developers —
            including my future self. Clear naming, explicit boundaries
            and simple flows are key.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I value communication and collaboration. The best solutions
            often emerge from discussions between developers,
            product owners and stakeholders.
        </p>
