        <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-10">About me</h1>

        <p class="text-2xl text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            I’m a backend-heavy full-stack developer and tech lead
            with a strong focus on architecture, maintainability
            and long-term thinking.
        </p>

    <!-- STORY -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-40 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">My journey</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide range of software projects —
            from internal tools to complex, long-running systems used daily
            by real users.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Early in my career, I focused primarily on writing code and delivering
            features. With time, I learned that the real challenges often appear
            months or years later — when systems grow, teams change and original
            assumptions no longer hold.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            This experience shaped how I approach software today.
            I care deeply about clarity, structure and decisions
            that make future development easier rather than harder.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MINDSET -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-40 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">How I think about software</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I believe software is a long-term investment.
            Every shortcut taken today has a cost that will eventually
            be paid by someone — often a future developer or the business itself.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I aim to reduce cognitive load wherever possible.
            Clear naming, explicit boundaries and simple flows
            help teams move faster in the long run.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I prefer boring, proven solutions applied thoughtfully.
            Novelty can be useful, but only when it clearly solves
            a real problem.
        </p>

    <!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-40 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">Architecture & responsibility</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Good architecture is not about complexity or fancy diagrams.
            It’s about responsibility, ownership and understanding
            where changes should and should not happen.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I strive to design systems that are understandable
            even to someone who joins the project years later.
            Architecture should guide developers, not confuse them.

        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">Working with people</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I’ve worked both as an individual contributor and
            in leadership roles.
            I value communication, trust and shared ownership.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            The best solutions often come from collaboration
            between developers, product owners and stakeholders.
            Technical decisions should serve the product, not ego.

    <!-- WHAT I AVOID -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-40 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">What I deliberately avoid</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Experience taught me that knowing what not to do
            is just as important as knowing what to build.
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-6 text-slate-400">
            <li>• Over-engineering without clear value</li>
            <li>• Blindly following trends and hype</li>
            <li>• Architectures only one person understands</li>
            <li>• Decisions driven by ego instead of product needs</li>

    <!-- PERSONAL -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mb-40 space-y-10">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">Beyond code</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Outside of work, I enjoy music, sci-fi, fantasy and anime.
            Side projects allow me to experiment, learn
            and explore ideas without pressure.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Building my own micro-SaaS products helps me stay grounded
            in real-world constraints — from deployment
            to maintenance and user feedback.
